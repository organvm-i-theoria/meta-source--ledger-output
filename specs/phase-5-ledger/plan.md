# Phase 5: The Perpetual Ledger - Plan

## Thesis: The Organizing Gravity
The core of the Meta-Source Ledger is not merely the visualization of code, but the **perpetual execution** of it. We are establishing a "Source" that runs on an immutable blockchain—a "Matrix" of governing codes and algorithms (Golden Ratio, Identity, Cipher) that cascade forward in perpetuity.

## Core Concept
*   **The Source:** A set of generative algorithms (smart contracts) living on-chain.
*   **Perpetuity:** Once deployed, these codes run forever, independent of any single host or interface.
*   **The Waterfall:** The data generated by these contracts "cascades forward," creating an ongoing historical record of the system's state.
*   **Artifacts:** External applications (visualizers, projections, identity kits) are merely "readers" or "manifestations" of this core truth. They interpret the on-chain data into sensory experiences.

## Technical Objectives
1.  **On-Chain Generative Engine:** Porting the core logic (from Phase 1-3) into smart contracts (e.g., Solidity/EVM or Solana).
    *   *Reference:* Autoglyphs (fully on-chain generative art).
2.  **The Heartbeat:** A mechanism for constant block-by-block generation or "pulse" (e.g., block hash seeding).
3.  **Artifact Protocol:** A standard for how off-chain entities "tap into" the Source to render visualizations.

## Roadmap
1.  **Protocol Definition:** Define the "Source Code" structure (the DNA of the universe).
2.  **Smart Contract Architecture:** Design the immutable logic containers.
3.  **Integration:** Connect Phase 2 (Cipher Renderer) and Phase 4 (Synthesis) as "Clients" of this new "Server" (The Blockchain).
