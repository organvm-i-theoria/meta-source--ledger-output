# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Nature

This is a **documentation and specification repository**—not a codebase with buildable software. It contains:
- Research documents and creative dialogues
- Technical specifications (TypeScript interfaces, architecture diagrams)
- Design frameworks for future implementation

There are no build commands, tests, or runnable code. Code snippets in specifications are illustrative examples.

## Architecture Overview

### Four-Phase Structure

The repository organizes 44 documents across four implementation phases:

1. **Phase 1: Identity Systems** (`extensions/phase-1-identity/`)
   - Numerology algorithms (Pythagorean, Chaldean, Gematria)
   - Temporal identity dynamics and state modeling
   - Data ethics framework

2. **Phase 2: Cipher Visualization** (`extensions/phase-2-cipher/`)
   - Unified cipher-agnostic state machine architecture
   - WebGL rendering specifications
   - Visual metaphor layers (Matrix cascade, rotor mechanics, flow diagrams)

3. **Phase 3: Mythology & Symbolism** (`extensions/phase-3-mythology/`)
   - 4444jPP symbolic system (project's design governance framework)
   - Golden ratio (φ) operators and generative systems
   - PROTOCALL notation language

4. **Phase 4: Synthesis** (`extensions/phase-4-synthesis/`)
   - Integrated Creative Platform (ICP) specification unifying all three engines
   - Cross-domain algorithms and hybrid compositions
   - Generative multiverse framework

### Core Concepts

**State Machine Paradigm**: All ciphers are treated as state transition machines with interchangeable visual renderers.

**4444jPP Governance**: The `4444jPP` token ("Quad Four J Double P") is the project's identity and design governance system. It decomposes as BLOCK (`4444`) + HINGE (`j`) + POSTS (`PP`).

**φ-Operators**: Golden ratio operations (`φ+` expand, `φ−` contract, `φ≈` align, `φ//` recalibrate, `φ🌀` recursive).

### Key Files

- `MANIFEST.md` — Complete annotated bibliography with thread registry linking documents to their source conversations
- `extensions/phase-4-synthesis/integrated-creative-platform-spec.md` — Master integration specification
- `extensions/phase-2-cipher/cipher-rendering-unified-architecture.md` — Core rendering architecture
- `research-prompts/` — Research methodology framework

### Technology Stack (Specified)

The specifications target:
- **Visualization**: p5.js, Three.js, WebGL shaders
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript
- **Audio**: Tone.js
- **Data**: PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM

## Working with This Repository

When modifying specifications:
- Update `MANIFEST.md` if adding/moving files (includes file paths, line counts, annotations)
- Maintain consistency with existing TypeScript interface patterns
- Respect the 4444jPP design governance principles in new specifications
- Use ASCII diagrams for architecture visualization (existing convention)

When researching:
- `research-prompts/` contains structured prompts for domain-specific investigation
- Source threads in `docs/source-threads/` preserve original creative dialogues
